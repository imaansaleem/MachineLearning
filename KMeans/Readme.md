# K-Means Clustering Algorithm

It contains my implementation for the k-means clustering algorithm.

## Introduction

I have implemented the k-means clustering algorithm, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for partitioning data into clusters. 

## Algorithm Overview

The k-means algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize k cluster centroids randomly.
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. Recalculate the centroids by computing the mean of data points in each cluster.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or a predefined number of iterations.
